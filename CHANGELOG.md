## 2026-07-22 Production Backend Readiness Updates
- Implemented 3-tier multi-tenant manager hierarchy (Super Admin -> Restaurant Manager -> Branch Manager).

## 2026-07-22 Minified React Error #310 Resolution & Phase 1 Launch Scope Filtering
- Fixed React Hook ordering rule violations across Admin Panel views (`BranchDashboard.tsx`, `OrderManagement.tsx`, `MenuManagement.tsx`).
- Resolved production dashboard crash ("Dashboard Encountered an Issue / Minified React error #310") by ensuring `useState` and `useMemo` hooks execute unconditionally before early returns.
- Restricted Super Admin Console (`AdminContext.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `SuperDashboard.tsx`, `TenantManagement.tsx`) to strictly display Phase 1 launch brands: **Tandoori Stop**, **Jush**, and **Get A Fomo**. All non-launch brands (*SeenBanao*, *DineAtBlue*, *SandMelts*, *BirdmanFoodsPK*) are hidden across all Super Admin selectors, metrics cards, and registries.
- Expanded `MOCK_MANAGERS` in `ManagerManagement.tsx` to list all 10 branch manager accounts across all branches of Tandoori Stop, Jush, and Get A Fomo.
- Built and verified production bundle (`npm run build` -> `dist/assets/index-DW_z81fs.js`).
